In ASP.NET Core 3.0 and higher, RazorViewEngineOptions.AllowRecompilingViewsOnFileChange is not available.
Surprised that refreshing a view while the app is running did not work, I discovered the following solution:

Add Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.RuntimeCompilation NuGet package to the project

Add the following in Startup.cs:
services.AddControllersWithViews().AddRazorRuntimeCompilation();
